// A capability is one keyboard function the firmware may or may not have. The
// UI asks for it by id and gets the capability or `undefined`; it never learns
// about absence from a failed request.
//
// Only what a consumer reads today is described here. Further contract fields
// (durability, atomic replace, order that carries meaning, destructive) join a
// capability with the first code that needs them, not ahead of it
// (docs/adr/0002-capability-contract.md).
